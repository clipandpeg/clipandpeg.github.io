							<h3 id="auto">Food to help with auto immune deseases</h3>
							<p>One of the most important contributors to autoimmune disease is nutrient deficiency (which of course, is built right into the Standard American diet, which while being rich in energy is very poor in actual nutrition). Even if you have been following a paleo, primal, GAPS, SCD, or WAPF diet for a while, it is likely that you have not corrected nutrient deficiencies (if you had, you probably wouldn’t be reading this page).</p>
							<p>Gut dysbiosis and a leaky gut are believed to be involved in all autoimmune diseases (and are present in every autoimmune disease which has been tested). The presence of gut dysbiosis and a leaky gut are directly related to diet and lifestyle (the foods you eat, the foods you don’t eat, how much sleep you get and how stressed you are). The diet recommendations of The Paleo Approach are all designed to help heal the gut, to restore normal/healthy gut microorganisms, to reduce inflammation and to regulate the immune system both through healing the gut, regulating hormones and addressing micronutrient deficiencies.</p>

							<h3 id="gut">Food to restore gut health and balance</h3>
							<p>Tummy troubles are unfortunately common in modern life. A mixture of food intolerances, stress and poor diet can leave some individuals prone to constipation, bloating and discomfort on a daily basis. The good news is that prebiotics and probiotics, active components found in foods and vario	us supplements, may offer some relief.</p>
							<p>Knows as the "good bacteria," probiotics are microorganisms naturally found in the human digestive tract that improve the balance of healthy bacteria. </p>

							<h3 id="type">Food and your blood type</h3>
							<p>Do you think knowing your blood type is only important in the event of a transfusion? Think again! Research indicates that your blood type is a key genetic factor that influences many areas of health and well-being.</p>
							<p>Throughout your life, you’ve probably observed that some people tend to lose weight more easily, while for others, their weight is an ongoing battle. Or wondered why some people are plagued by chronic illness while others stay healthy and vital well into their advanced years. Very simply, the answer is in your blood type.</p>
							<p>Knowing your blood type is an important tool for understanding how your body reacts to food, your susceptibility to disease, your natural reaction to stress, and so much more. A single drop of blood contains a biochemical makeup as unique to you as your fingerprint. .</p>
